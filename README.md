## Getting Started

To install this application, run the following commands:


```bash git clone https://github.com/devRobots/spring-boot-ecommerce.git spring-boot-ecommerce
cd spring-boot-ecommerce
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.

To run the server, run:
 
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To run the client, run:
 
```bash
cd ecommerce-frontend
npm start
```

### Database Configuration

You will need to create an MySQL Table in MySQL Server to get and persist your data.

Log in to your MySQL Client session and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web**, click **Next**, and give the app a name youâ€™ll remember. Specify `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta` as a Login redirect URI. Click **Done**, then click **Edit** to edit General Settings. Add `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:8080` as Logout redirect URIs, then click **Save**. 

Set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` into `src/main/resources/application.yml`. 

### Server Configuration

Set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` into `src/main/resources/application.yml`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.oktapreview.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!
